# Final Project
## Domain of Interest
Our chosen domain of interest is _happiness_. We chose this specific domain because happiness is an integral part of human life and is difficult to define, yet constantly pursued. This allows happiness to be explored in many different facets, providing interesting datasets to explore this topic.

## Data Driven Projects
An example of a data driven project is [World Happiness Report Visualization](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/world-happiness-report-visualization/), which focuses on the correlation between certain variables and the happiness score. Another example of a data driven project involving happiness is [Happiness and Life Satisfaction](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction), which yet again compares happiness multiple different variables and draws conclusions based on those. The final data driven project we discovered was [The World Happiness Report: An Explaratory Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/nateofspades/The-World-Happiness-Report-An-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/master/WorldHappinessReportEDA.ipynb), which once again performs the same actions of relating variables to happiness levels globally.

## Questions
1. How does GDP per capita relate to happiness within the United States?
2. How does the number of McDonald's relate to happiness within the United States?
3. How does the number of national holidays per year relate to happiness?

## Datasets

1. Happiest States 2020

The data was downloaded online via the project website. It was collected by _WalletHub_, and looked at both internal and external factors that affected the happiness of US residents per state. There are _three_ main categories: **emotional and physical well-being, work environment, and community and environment**. There are 50 rows, one for each state, and six columns: **rank**, **state**, **total score**, and a column for each of the above categories. Using the data from this dataset, we can answer questions about an individual's happiness based on their location, occupation, and interpersonal relationships.
